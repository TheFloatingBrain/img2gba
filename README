DESCRIPTION:
------------

GBAconv is a set of tools aimed at GameBoy Advance developers, allowing
to convert WAV sounds and PCX images into C arrays to be included in
GBA programs.

It is composed of two programs:

pcx2gba: exports a PCX 8-bpp image to 16-bit values C arrays
         (palette + image data (2 pixels per value))
wav2gba: exports a WAV 8-bit mono sound to 8-bit signed values array.

There won't be any other releases of GBAconv, as I've no interest for
the GBA platform anymore.



COMPILING:
----------

Simply type "make" to compile the programs.

They have been successfully compiled on:

- 32-bit x86 Architecture (Ubuntu Linux 5.10, FreeBSD 5.4)



USAGE:

pcx2gba input.pcx output.inc array_name (Input File must be 8-bit PCX)
